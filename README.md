## What I wish I knew before going oncall 

Firefighting a broken system is time-sensitive and stressful, but becomes even more challenging as teams and systems evolve. As an on-call engineer, scaling processes among humans is an important problem to solve. How do we ramp up new engineers effectively? How can we bring existing on-call engineers up to speed? In this workshop we’ll share common myths among new on-call engineers and the Do’s and Don’ts of on-call onboarding, as well as run through hands-on activities you can take back to work and apply directly to your own on-call processes.
